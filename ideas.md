__these were finished when writing this file up__
 - ✅ windows tts all chat messages
 - ✅ mute my desktop audio
 - ✅ while holding `W`--or whatever is forward--have a 10% chance of stepping onto a mouse trap & then yelling like Tom Cat & spin the mouse into the air
 - ✅ show an ad every 30 seconds, and make it play for 10 seconds before skipping
 - ✅ wheel of fortune guessing phrase part but it's wheel of closing my fucking game (or something else)


__working on__
 - when pressing any key, play either:
  * seinfield (like in midi mario) when pushing any button
  * rat burp
  * "M:\-- random bullshit\garfield in pojabe"
  * "M:\Memes\yep.mp4"
  * "M:\Memes\bowling.mp4"
  * record 2 seconds of the streamer's voice (randomize the pitch)
 -...and changing it's pitch to sound like a soundfont/midi


__ideas__
 - make streamer solve a captcha

 - change the brightness of my monitor every 30 seconds to something random


__things that i can't so much do with commands or code__ like:
 - ✅ using the small mouse
 - ✅ invert my mouse
 - ✅ use funny mic
