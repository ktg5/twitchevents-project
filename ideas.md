 - ✅ windows tts all chat messages
 - ✅ mute my desktop audio
 - ✅ while holding `W`--or whatever is forward--have a 10% chance of stepping onto a mouse trap & then yelling like Tom Cat & spin the mouse into the air
 - ✅ show an ad every 30 seconds, and make it play for 10 seconds before skipping



 - make streamer solve a captcha

 - when pressing any key, play either:
  * seinfield (like in midi mario) when pushing any button
  * record 2 seconds of the streamer's voice (randomize the pitch)
 -...and changing it's pitch to sound like a soundfont/midi (use `ffplay "[audio-location]" -nodisp -af "rubberband=tempo=1.0:pitch=1.5:pitchq=quality"`, don't think windows built-in stuff can do it)

 - make chat guess a random word or phrase, then make computer freak the fuck out

 - change the brightness of my monitor every 30 seconds to something random

things that i can't so much do with commands or code like:
 - using the small mouse
 - invert my mouse
 - use funny mic
